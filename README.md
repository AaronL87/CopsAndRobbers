# CopsAndRobbers
## Combinatorics research game

### A game of 'drunken' cops and robbers, where the cop and robber move randomly on an 0-indexed, mxn matrix. 

### The goal is to see the probability of the cop capturing the robber under various conditions, including:
#### Various sizes of a matrix, which the cop and robber traverse.
#### A probability representing how 'drunk' the robber and cop are, meaning how often they forget to move.
#### Whether the cop is chasing the robber or randomly moving, and whether the robber is escaping the cop or randomly moving.
#### Whether the robber can make a 2-square move.
